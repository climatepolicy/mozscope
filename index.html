<h1>Mozambique Scoping Update</h1>
<ul>
<li><h2>Mozambique uses a lot of land for energy and a little for food (Physical)</h2>
<p>Land can be used for food, for fuel, or for ecosystem services.  In Mozambique, most land is being used for low-value fuel, and the land being used for food is used unproductively.  This leads to poverty, as the country has little to sell, and food insecurity, as the country has little to eat.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3>Today, most land is not being used to its potential</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>A huge amount of land is used for charcoal and firewood.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most agricultural land is used for local production</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Local crops include cassava, poultry, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A small amount of land is dedicated to export agriculture</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some land is protected, but effectiveness is hard to discern</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A few parks and reserves</p>
</li>
<li><p>A few voluntary carbon offsets projects</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Mozambique&#39;s high-quality land could produce more</h3>
<p>This section is about physical potential. Policy and non-policy barriers prevent the interventions here from taking place, and those will be discussed in the policy/fiscal section.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Existing waste can be converted to energy</p>
<p>Sugar mills are producing energy, but could produce more and export it to the grid.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Energy can be obtained from other sources</p>
<p>Using land for energy currently makes sense economically, as the investment needed for higher-value uses is constrained.  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>New gas reserves mean natural gas will be plentiful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Solar energy may make sense off-grid</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ethanol has potential, but may be outcompeted by gas</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>High value foods currently imported can be produced locally</p>
<ul>
<li>Cassava</li>
<li>Wheat</li>
<li>Maize</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Poultry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Exports of high value food can be increased.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Sugar</li>
<li>Tropical fruits</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h2>Unlocking Productive Land use in Mozambique: CPI priorities moving forward [PRELIMINARY]</h2>
<ul>
<li><h3>Obtaining land concessions the right way</h3>
<p>Investors must undertake two processes in parallel.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MINAG Approval</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start by working with the local government</p>
</li>
<li><p>Local government will engage provincial/national if needed</p>
<ul>
<li><p>for concessions over 10,000 ha</p>
</li>
<li><p>where their expertise is insufficient</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>CPI Approval (centro de promoÃ§Ã£o de investimento)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Must approve all foreign investments</p>
</li>
<li><p>This process is easier than the above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Improve lacking infrastructure</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Transit of goods is too slow to react to markets and keep things fresh.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Electricity grid is lacking, and off-grid renewables policy is poorly developed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>For now, we on areas where infrastructure is improving, or focus on integrated local markets</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Beira Corridor is currently undergoing significant upgrades</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gas investment near Pemba is leading to rapid infrastructure buildout.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h3>Locally consolidated value chains can be profitable even absent infrastructure.</h3>
<p>For example, chicken feed (soy + maize) and chickens near urban centers.  </p>
</li>
<li><h3>Cogeneration from sugar sector: FiT is currently being finalized - investment should be profitable in 2014.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
